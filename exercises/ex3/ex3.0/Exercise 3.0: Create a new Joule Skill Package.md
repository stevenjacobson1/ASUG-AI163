3.  In the "Create Joule Skill" dialog, enter the following details.

> **Improvement: Integrated Step Logic**
> The `IMPORTANT` note and the data table are now integrated directly into Step 3. This creates a more logical flow where the user reads the instruction, gets the critical context for the data, and then sees the data itself—all within a single, cohesive step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You must use your unique UserID.**
> Before filling in the fields, note that you need to replace `<UserID>` with your assigned user number (e.g., if your user is `T-AI163-050`, you would use `T-AI163-050`). This is crucial for uniquely identifying your project.

| Field         | Value                                     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Name**        | `Logistics Agent <UserID>`                  |
| **Description** | `Joule skills for GTT shipment management.` |

4.  After filling in the details, click **Review**, then click **Create**.
