# Ex. 3: 💡 Understanding Joule Skills

**Joule Skills** are modular components within SAP’s conversational AI framework, designed to execute **atomic, predefined operations** within a business context.Each skill performs a single task — such as retrieving data, triggering transactions, or querying systems — based on structured inputs and deterministic logic. Their purpose is to streamline repetitive, rule-based activities by providing a **fast, reliable, and reusable automation mechanism**.

Functioning within clearly defined parameters, Joule Skills are ideal for **low-complexity, high-frequency operations** where consistency and precision are critical.  
They are tightly integrated with **SAP and third-party APIs** via **SAP Build Actions**, enabling seamless execution of system-level commands.  
While they can understand conversation context, their logic is **non-adaptive** — flows are static, and outcomes are predictable.

> 💡 **Note:** Joule Skills can be triggered:
> 
>    - through SAP Joule’s conversational interface
>    - through another Joule Skills
>    - through Joule Agent
