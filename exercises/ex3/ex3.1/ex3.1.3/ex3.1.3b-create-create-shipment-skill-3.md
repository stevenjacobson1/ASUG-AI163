## Ex. 3.1.3b - Add 'Send Message' Steps to Condition Branches in Joule Skill
<br> A 'Send Message' step enables you to send a personalized & pre-defined message to the end user in addition to the standard Joule response. 
<br> We will be creating 2 "Send Message" steps, one for each of the Condition branches created in the previous exercise. 

1. In Branch 1, click on the <img width="20" height="20" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd09a02b-cd57-409e-91e5-734e03150803" /> button & select 'Send Response' followed by 'Send Message'. Repeat the step for Branch 2, as well.

## Summary — Ex. 3.1.3b: Add 'Send Message' Steps to Condition Branches in Joule Skill

This page explains how to add **“Send Message”** steps in the Joule Skill to provide personalized and pre-defined feedback messages to users.  
These messages are displayed in addition to the standard Joule response when a shipment is **created** or **updated** in the SAP Business Network GTT system.

The exercise builds on the condition branches from the previous step and includes:

### 1. Creating Send Message Steps
Two **Send Message** steps are created—one for each condition branch:
- **Branch 1:** For a new shipment, a `Create Shipment Message` is configured.
- **Branch 2:** For an existing shipment, a `Shipment Update Message` is configured.

### 2. Configuring the "Create Shipment Message"
This step configures an illustrated message with the title "Success" and text confirming the shipment was created, along with a button to view the shipment.

### 3. Configuring the "Shipment Update Message"
This step configures a similar illustrated message with the title "Carrier Updated" to confirm the update was successful.
