# Summary — Exercise 3.1.3: Create the Final Joule Skill

This page explains how to create the **final Joule Skill** in the SAP **Joule Skill Package**, named **“Create Shipment.”**  
The purpose of this skill is to **create or update a shipment** in the **SAP Business Network Global Track and Trace (GTT)** system.  
In an update scenario, only the carrier name is required.

The exercise continues from the previous steps and includes the following main actions:

- Creating a new **Joule Skill** called `Create Shipment <UserID>` with a description indicating its purpose for creating or updating shipment details.  
- Defining **input parameters** required to create or update shipments
- Adding a new **action** to create shipments using the **`createshipment`** action.  
- Opening the **Skill Builder** and selecting **“Call Action”** to connect this backend operation.  
- Creating a new **destination variable** named `PostToGTT`, which serves as the connection point to send shipment data to the GTT system.
- Ensuring the destination is saved and correctly selected within the project.  

Once completed, this Joule Skill enables users to **create new shipments** or **update existing ones** within the GTT system via Joule.  
The page concludes with a link to the next exercise, which focuses on mapping the **input variables** of the action project with the Joule Skill inputs.
