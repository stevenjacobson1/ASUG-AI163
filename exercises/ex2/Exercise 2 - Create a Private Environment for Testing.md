# Exercise 2 - Create a Private Environment for Testing

## ⚙️ Understanding the Private Environment Concept

**Joule Studio** now offers a dedicated **Private Environment** designed to provide a safe, isolated space for experimenting with **Joule Agents**.  
It allows developers and business users to build, test, and refine their configurations **without affecting any shared or productive environments**.

Within the Private Environment, you can:
- Safely experiment with new agent logic, skills, and actions.  
- Test agent conversations and workflows **during design time (before deployment)**.  
- Identify and fix configuration or integration issues early, ensuring a smoother rollout to production.  

In other words, the Private Environment acts as a **sandbox** where you can freely iterate on your Joule Agents.

> 💡 **Good to know:**  
> Each user has their own Private Environment, meaning that tests and changes performed here do not interfere with other users or productive Joule instances.  
> You can reset or reconfigure it anytime without impacting organizational data.


## 🧩 Create your Private Environment

## 🌟 What's Next

The **Private Environment** you’ve just created will serve as your **safe testing space** for Joule Agents — a dedicated area where you can experiment, make changes, and validate your setup without impacting others.

Now that your environment is ready, let’s move on to **Joule Studio** project set up, where you will copy our pre-created project and **create your first Joule Skill**, which will later be used by the Joule Agent as part of its end-to-end workflow.
