# Exercise 1 - Test an Action Project

## ⚙️ Understand the Action Project

**SAP Build Action** — a low-code/no-code API layer that enables **Joule Skills** to securely interact with any backend system.  
It allows you to define, test, and expose actions without writing complex integration code, making it easier to connect Joule to enterprise data and processes.

In this hands-on scenario, we will use two action projects to connect to an **SAP Business Networks GTT system**. One Action projects  to read Shipment details using its Tracking ID or Delay Status (GTTReadService) & the other to create a shipment (GTTShipment).

The GTTReadService Action project will be used by **two Joule Skills**:
- `Track Shipment`: A Skill to track shipments using its Tracking ID.  
- `Delayed Shipment`: A skill to get all delayed shipments using its Delay Status.

The GTTShipment Action project is used by the **Joule Skill**: 
- `Create Shipment`: A skill to create shipment or update shipment with ONLY carrier name.

Now that we understand the Action project’s role in the architecture, let’s test it to confirm that the backend connection works as expected.

## 🧩  Test Action Project

Testing validates that:
- The backend destination (`gttGetService`) is correctly configured and reachable.  
- The action correctly receives and processes input parameters.  
- The output data is as expected.
  
###  Step 1: Open Action Project

In the left panel of the lobby area, expand ‘Connectors’ and click on ‘Actions’

Search for the action project, `GTTReadService`. Click on it to open

###  Step 2:  Set Required Values for Testing
1. Click on the Test tab.
2. Select the destination as `gttGetService` from the dropdown.
3. enter the requestId filter string as `trackingId eq  '6100005200'`.
4. Click the Test button.

###  Step 3:  Get Succesful API Response 
<br> Result: Response should be ‘200 OK’ and you should be able to view the response payload.

## 🌟 What's Next

By testing the Action project, we explored the **input parameters** required for it to function correctly and confirmed that the connection works as expected. 

However, before we start creating the Joule Skill, we first need to **set up a Private Environment for testing**.  
This environment will provide a secure and isolated space to deploy and test the Joule Agents without affecting other configurations.  

Once the Private Environment is ready, we’ll proceed to **use the tested Action** as part of our Joule Skill to complete the end-to-end flow.
